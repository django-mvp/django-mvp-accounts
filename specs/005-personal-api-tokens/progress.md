## 2026-10-08T09:36:36Z · Plan · T001

Did: research, plan and tasks written from the approved prototype. Ledger created.
Verified: prototype pages walked on the demo before approval. No tests yet.
Next: design review, then T001.
Watch: the approved templates keep their markup and words.

Did: raised the api extra's Django REST framework bound to >=3.16,<4 and re-locked (uv lock, uv sync). Added TestApiExtra (bounds of both requirements, neither a runtime dependency) and TestDemoApiTokens (knox's token model installed, makemigrations --check clean) to tests/test_demo.py.
Verified: `uv run pytest tests/test_demo.py::TestApiExtra tests/test_demo.py::TestDemoApiTokens -q` 5 passed. Red step: the DRF bound test failed first (3.15.2 still allowed); the knox-installed and no-migration tests passed on first run because T001 kept knox in the demo, so they pin an existing state rather than driving a change. pre-commit run --all-files passed.
Next: T003, AuthTokenFactory.
Watch: knox's bound was already >=5.0,<6 in the extra.
